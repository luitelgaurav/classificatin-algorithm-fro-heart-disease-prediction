The project is based on analysis, visualization and modeling of “Heart disease dataset” obtained from University of California Irvine machine learning repository. The dataset includes 14 unique attributes and 303 instances without any null values. Target is of categorical type, 1 for diagnosis of heart disease and 0 for no diagnosis of heart disease. Three different classification algorithm namely, K-Nearest neighbor, Decision tree and Logistic regression are used for model accuracy and predicting accuracy scores.
